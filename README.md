# deck.gl

A WebGL overlay suite for React providing a set of highly performant
data visualization overlays.

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

Design goals:
- Provide overlays that plug directly into react-map-gl's overlay model,
  enabling overlays to work on maps.
- Provide highly performant data visualization overlays in 2 and 3 dimensions.
- Provide tested, highly performant layers for basic data visualization
  use cases, scatterplots, choropleths etc.
- Allows easy creation of custom WebGL layers by subclassing `Layer`.
- Support efficient WebGL rendering in "data flow architecture" applications
  (i.e. React).
- Special focus on buffer management, allowing both automatic buffer updates
  but also full application control of buffer allocation and management


Features:
- Web Mercator projections are handled in shader on GPU. No projections are
  done in JavaScript (unless needed for a uniform calculation or reverse
  projection of e.g. picked coordinate etc). Specify your lat,lon once and
  never touch it again.
- Can accept data stored in any ES6 container
  (supporting \[Symbol.iterator\] iteration).
- Automatic and manual WebGL buffer management to support.


## Installation

```
npm install --save deck.gl

## Usage

```
import {
  DeckGLOverlay,
  /* import layers here */
} from 'deck.gl';

const mapState = {
  latitude: 37.55,
  longitude: -122.2,
  zoom: 9,
  ...
}

<DeckGLOverlay
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
  mapState={mapState},  // optional
  layers={[/* put layer instances here */]}
/>
```

---

## Example
```
npm run start
```

```
Note: **Building** deck.gl (not importing) has a dependency on node
version 0.12 or higher. If you use an older version, you can install
a node version manager like nvm and use a separate shell to install
and build deck.gl
```
npm install -g nvm && nvm install 0.12 && nvm use 0.12
```
